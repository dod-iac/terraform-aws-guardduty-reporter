/**
 *
 * ## Description
 *
 * Provisions a guard duty detector and sets up a subscription
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * After deploying the [Report Receiver](https://github.com/dod-iac/terraform-aws-report-receiver) in the receiving account, use the output role and kinesis from that module with this
 *
 * Resources:
 *
 *
  ```hcl
    module "guardduty_stream" {
    source                = "../../modules/kinesiss-stream-config"
    source_account        = data.aws_caller_identity.current.id
    security_group_ids    = [module.elmo.es_ingress_sg]
    subnet_ids            = module.elmo.private_subnet_ids
    opensearch_domain_arn = module.elmo.es_domain
    stream_type           = "guardduty"
    error_logging_bucket  = module.elmo.logging_bucket
    }
    module "guardduty" {
    source             = "../../modules/guard-duty-deployment"
    role_arn           = module.guardduty_stream.publish_role_arn
    kinesis_stream_arn = module.guardduty_stream.kinesis_stream_arn
    }
```
 *
 * ## Testing
 *
 * Run all terratest tests using the `terratest` script.  If using `aws-vault`, you could use `aws-vault exec $AWS_PROFILE -- terratest`.  The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is required by the tests.  Use `TT_SKIP_DESTROY=1` to not destroy the infrastructure created during the tests.  Use `TT_VERBOSE=1` to log all tests as they are run.  Use `TT_TIMEOUT` to set the timeout for the tests, with the value being in the Go format, e.g., 15m.  The go test command can be executed directly, too.
 *
 * ## Terraform Version
 *
 * Terraform 0.13. Pin module version to ~> 1.0.0 . Submit pull-requests to master branch.
 *
 * Terraform 0.11 and 0.12 are not supported.
 *
 * ## License
 *
 * This project constitutes a work of the United States Government and is not subject to domestic copyright protection under 17 USC ยง 105.  However, because the project utilizes code licensed from contributors and other third parties, it therefore is licensed under the MIT License.  See LICENSE file for more information.
 *
 * ## Developer Setup
 *
 * This template is configured to use aws-vault, direnv, go, pre-commit, terraform-docs, and tfenv.  If using Homebrew on macOS, you can install the dependencies using the following code.
 *
 * ```shell
 * brew install aws-vault direnv go pre-commit terraform-docs tfenv
 * pre-commit install --install-hooks
 * ```
 *
 * If using `direnv`, add a `.envrc.local` that sets the default AWS region, e.g., `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2`.
 *
 * If using `tfenv`, then add a `.terraform-version` to the project root dir, with the version you would like to use.
